## Abstract

The rapid increase in the global population of older adults presents a significant challenge, but also a unique opportunity to leverage technological advancements for promoting independent living and well-being. This study introduces the CIREI framework, which is a comprehensive model designed to enhance the integration of smart home and assistive technologies specifically for pre-frail older adults. Developed through a systematic literature review and innovative and comprehensive co-design activities, the CIREI framework captures the nuanced needs, preferences, and challenges faced by older adults, caregivers, and experts. Key findings from the co-design workshop highlight critical factors such as usability, privacy, and personalised learning preferences, which directly influence technology adoption. These insights informed the creation of an intelligent middleware prototype named WISE-WARE, which seamlessly integrates commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices to support health management and improve the quality of life for older adults. The CIREI framework's adaptability ensures it can be extended and refined to meet the ever-changing needs of the ageing population, providing a robust foundation for future research and development in user-centred technology design.
