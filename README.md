# CIREI Project and WISE-WARE Middleware

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **CIREI and WISE-WARE Middleware** repository. This project introduces a middleware solution designed to enhance the integration of robots with embodied intelligence in the homes of older adults living with frailty. Our solution, developed under the CIREI framework, facilitates interoperability between commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, enabling smarter, more adaptive environments that promote independent living for older individuals.

The research combines a systematic literature review with co-design activities involving older adults, caregivers, and technology experts to understand the barriers and facilitators to assistive technology adoption. The result is WISE-WARE, an intelligent middleware prototype that seamlessly integrates diverse assistive technologies to support health management and improve quality of life.
