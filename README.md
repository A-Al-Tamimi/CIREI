# CIREI and WISEWARE Middleware

## Overview

Welcome to the **CIREI and WISEWARE Middleware** repository. This project introduces a middleware solution designed to enhance the integration of robots with embodied intelligence in the homes of older adults living with frailty. Our solution, developed under the CIREI framework, facilitates interoperability between commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, enabling smarter, more adaptive environments that promote independent living for older individuals.
