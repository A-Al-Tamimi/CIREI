# CIREI and WISEWARE Middleware

## Overview

Welcome to the **CIREI and WISEWARE Middleware** repository. This project introduces a middleware solution designed to enhance the integration of robots with embodied intelligence in the homes of older adults living with frailty. Our solution, developed under the CIREI framework, facilitates interoperability between commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, enabling smarter, more adaptive environments that promote independent living for older individuals.

This repository contains the middleware's source code, workshop materials, project documentation, and demonstration videos that illustrate the installation process and real-life application with a variety of devices.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi (running Raspberry Pi OS) or any compatible Linux environment.
- Smart home devices from various manufacturers that support communication through the middleware.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi or local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CIREI-WISEWARE.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `/src` directory and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd src
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Follow the setup instructions provided in the [documentation](./docs/installation_guide.md) for configuring your smart devices.
